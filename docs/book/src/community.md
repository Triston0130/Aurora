# Roadmap & Community

Aurora is a collaborative research effort. This chapter outlines how to follow
progress, contribute work, and share results with the broader community.

## Roadmap

The master checklist in [`docs/TODO.md`](../../TODO.md) records every milestone
on the path to Aurora 1.0. Each item references concrete deliverables (language
features, runtime services, tooling, research artefacts). Pair it with
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) for timeline context.

## Contributing

1. Pick an open task or file an RFC under `docs/reference/`.
2. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
3. Run `./tools/ci.sh` before requesting review.
4. Submit a PR referencing the relevant checklist item.

The contribution guide (`docs/reference/CONTRIBUTING.md`) documents code style,
commit hygiene, and review expectations. For deep technical discussions, open a
Design Record in `design/adr/`.

## Outreach & Research

- Press kit and release materials live in `docs/outreach/`.
- Blog posts and talk outlines (also in `docs/outreach/`) help you present
  Aurora at meetups and conferences.
- Academic collaborations are tracked in `research/`, including citation lists
  and experiment notebooks.

## Community Channels

- **GitHub Discussions** (planned) for design debates and Q&A.
- **Matrix/Discord** (planned) for synchronous pairing and mentoring sessions.
- **Mailing list** (planned) for release announcements and research summaries.

Until the public channels launch, coordinate through issues and PR threads. Keep
conversations transparent so future contributors can trace decisions.
