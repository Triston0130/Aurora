# Aurora Research Notes

This directory houses literature reviews, comparative analyses, and experiment logs underpinning Auroraâ€™s design decisions.

## Structure
- `notes/`: Daily research journal, meeting minutes, exploratory proofs.
- `citations/`: BibTeX databases, annotated bibliographies, Zotero exports.

## Immediate Actions
1. Compile existing references on effect systems, region-based memory, and actor runtimes.
2. Draft comparative matrix contrasting Aurora with Rust, Koka, Cyclone, and Pony.
3. Establish template for experiment reports (hypothesis, methodology, results, implications).

## Citation Style
Use ACM reference format by default. Provide stable URLs or DOIs for all sources.
