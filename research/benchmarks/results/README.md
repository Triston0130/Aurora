# Benchmark Results

Store human-readable summaries (Markdown/CSV) of Criterion runs in this
directory. Each file should include:

- Commit hash and date.
- Machine specifications (CPU, RAM, OS, Rust version).
- Command used to execute the benchmarks.
- Extracted metrics (median, mean, std-dev) for each scenario.

Raw Criterion output lives in `target/criterion/` and can be archived as needed.
