# Participant Guide

Thank you for helping evaluate the Aurora programming environment. This guide
explains what to expect during the 90‑minute remote session.

## Before the Session
- Ensure you have a GitHub account and access to a Unix-like shell (macOS, Linux,
  or WSL).
- Install Rust via `rustup` if not already available.
- Clone the repository ahead of time (optional):
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Triston0130/Aurora.git
  ```
- Review the Aurora README to get a feel for the project goals.

## Session Agenda
1. **Welcome & consent (5 min)** – confirm recording permission and answer
   questions.
2. **Pre-study survey (5 min)** – short form covering background and experience.
3. **Hands-on tasks (60 min)**
   - Workspace setup & CI helper
   - Modify / run a provided example (CPU web server or GPU blur)
   - Extend a zone policy or effect handler using the docs
   - Apply lint/format tools to a guided patch
4. **Debrief & post-study survey (15 min)** – System Usability Scale + open-ended
   feedback.
5. **Wrap-up (5 min)** – discuss next steps and compensation details.

## Logistics
- Sessions are run over video conference with screen sharing enabled.
- A moderator will provide prompts but you should narrate your thoughts while
  working (“think aloud”).
- Feel free to ask clarifying questions about task goals but not about how to
  solve them unless explicitly offered hints.

## After the Session
- You will receive a link to upload any notes or patches you produced.
- A follow-up email summarises survey scores and links to the public findings
  once published.

Thank you again for contributing to Aurora's usability research!
