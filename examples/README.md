# Aurora Examples

This directory will host canonical Aurora programs illustrating language features.

## Planned Samples
- `hello_world.aur`: minimal program with inferred types.
- `effects/`: functions demonstrating effect polymorphism and error handling patterns.
- `concurrency/`: actor pipelines, structured concurrency blocks, async/await usage.
- `zones/`: GPU offload kernel and real-time control loop sample.
- `ffi/`: integration with C library (e.g., SQLite binding).

Each example must include a markdown explanation describing design choices and compiler/runtime expectations.
