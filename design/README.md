# Aurora Design Records

The design track maintains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), RFCs, and system blueprints.

## Structure (planned)
- `adr/`: Markdown documents capturing immutable design decisions.
- `rfcs/`: Proposals under discussion.
- `models/`: Diagrams, state machines, and dataflow descriptions.

## Immediate Actions
1. Draft ADR template capturing context, decision, consequences.
2. Record initial ADR covering Aurora’s type-and-effect system commitment. *(Done — see `adr/0001-effect-rows.md`.)*
3. Establish RFC numbering and review workflow aligned with weekly meetings.

Design artefacts should cross-reference research notes and specification sections to maintain traceability.
